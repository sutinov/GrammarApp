      <h1>the Past Continuous</h1>
      <h3>
        The past continuous (also called past progressive) is a verb tense which
        is used to show that an ongoing past action was happening at a specific
        moment of interruption, or that two ongoing actions were happening at
        the same time.
      </h3>
      <p>e.g. The sun <strong>was shining</strong> every day that summer.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>How to Form the Past Continuous</h2>
      <h4>
        The past continuous is made from the past tense of the verb
        <strong>be</strong> and the <strong> â€“ing form</strong> of a verb.
      </h4>
      <p>
        e.g. <span>She was talking constantly in class in those days.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many situations in which this verb tense might be used in a
        sentence. For example, it is often used to describe conditions that
        existed in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        e.g.
        <em>The sun <strong>was shining</strong> every day that summer.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also be used to describe something that was happening
        continuously in the past when another action interrupted it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I <strong>was making </strong>dinner when she arrived.</em>
      </p>
