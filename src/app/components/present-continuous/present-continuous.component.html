      <h1>the Present Continuous</h1>
      <h3>
        The present continuous (also called present progressive) is a verb tense
        which is used to show that an ongoing action is happening now, either at
        the moment of speech or now in a larger sense. The present continuous
        can also be used to show that an action is going to take place in the
        near future.
      </h3>

      <br /><br />
      <h2>How to Form the Present Continuous</h2>
      <p>
        We make it using the present simple of <strong>'be' + verb-ing:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        e.g. Aunt Christine is <b> warming up </b>the car while Scott looks for
        his new leather coat. They <b>are eating</b> at Scott’s favorite
        restaurant today, Polly’s Pancake Diner.
